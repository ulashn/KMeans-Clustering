# KMeans-Clustering

- This python code is an application of KMeans Clustering algorithm with Color Quantization.
- Simply takes the image file as an argument with also some constants.

# Usage

`$ python main.py <image_file_name> <number_of_colors> <max_iterations> <epsilon>`

- Example: `$ python main.py ./inputs 4 10 1`

I also added some example runs for quantizations with sample input images.
